# Excel Data Pipeline: A Simple Overview

## What Does This System Do?
This system takes Excel files and transforms them into clean, organized data that's ready for database use. 

## Architecture Flow
1. Upload -> Files arrive in monitored directory
2. Raw Storage -> Original files archived with timestamps
3. Ingestion -> File Handler processes one file at a time
4. Validation -> Data Processor performs checks and transformations
5. Output -> Clean data exported to database-ready format

## Data Processing Details
### Parsing & Validation
- Column type inference using sampling
- Schema validation against expected formats
- Multi-level header parsing and normalization
- Null value detection and handling

### Type Inference & Date Handling
- Automatic type detection for columns
- Date format normalization using DateUtil
- Consistent datetime output format
- Handling of multiple input date formats

## Scalability & Processing
- Stateless processing enables horizontal scaling
- File-level parallel processing capability
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Independent worker processes per file

## Error Management & Logging
### Error Handling
- File issues (can't open, wrong format)
- Structure problems (bad headers, wrong layout)
- Data problems (invalid values, wrong formats)
- System issues (out of memory, technical errors)

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging for all operations
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Processing metrics collection
- Audit trail of all transformations
